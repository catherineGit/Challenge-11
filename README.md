# Challenge-11
- In this Challenge, I use the prophet model with default 80% confidence interval to predict the future trend of data change
- I use the google colab for coding, so all the codes with code outputs are saved in the "forecasting_net_prophet_colab_code.ipynb" file, and the questions from this challenge are answered saved in the original starter code file "forcasting_net_prophet.ipynb" file, which doesn't have code output displayed due to output cannot be copied and pasted directly.
